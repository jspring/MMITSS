Writing a TCP based client using POSIX Linux C API (Part 2)

I explained some TCP/IP theory and wrote a sockets based TCP server in previous tutorial. I intend to continue that with a client.

A client is an application which connects itself to the server and is the initiator of the communication. Generally speaking client code is much simpler than the server. However, apart from codeâ€™s point of view, I would like to explain a few very important concepts that I have found severely lacking in even people experienced with sockets based programming.

In every communication using TCP as transport protocol, we have a connection. Now what exactly does that mean? I know it is 3 way handshake i.e. 3 packets exchanged called syn, syn-ack and ack-ack.
Mostly people would say it kind of checks if the other end is ready to talk or is used for achieving reliability.

Let me clarify. Reliability in TCP comes from sending acknowledgements i.e. every packet sent contains a sequence number and the other side has a way to acknowledge that sequence number so that we know what we sent was successfully received. So we could simply have a client which starts by sending data and expects acknowledgements. Does that make it reliable? Yes! Does that make it TCP? No!!

What do we do in the first three packets? One better known aspect is, we exchange an initial sequence number so the other end knows what number my data bytes will be ordered from. But other than that, we say we establish connection! Now obviously we are not dedicating a physical line or getting something similar. But there still is a very fundamental difference between how tcp packets travel vs how UDP does. TCP establishes a virtual circuit which means for the life of this connection ALL Packets follow the same path. So it is this path that is negotiated in the initial 3 way handshake. In contrast all UDP packets use datagram switching i.e. they make routing decisions at every node and might follow different paths for one communication set. Of course it is not all, 3 way handshake also exchanges the window size and may be a few other parameters. But this is a very important difference between the behavior of TCP vs UDP packets.

IP address helps to reach the destination machine where as port number identifies which application we are actually communicating with.
